- ssl certificates secure online transactions
- workflow of ssl certificates:
    1. browser requests server for ID
    2. web server sends copy of its SSL to the browser
    3. browser decides whether it accepts SSL, if accepted there will be a handshake
    4. server sends digital acknowledgement and SSL encrypted session is created

- in requests.get('', Verify=True) - this is the default nature of the line
- requests can also ignore verifying SSL through verify=False
- if you have custom certificates, download the certificates, place them into working directory and add to verify = '<custom_cert>'

- to export scraped data to a csv file, first we need to import:
    1. 'from csv import writer' imports necessary packages to deal with csv files
    2. 'with open('csvfile', 'w', encoding = 'utf8', newline='') as f:' opens csv file, writes on it with utf8 encoding opened as f
    3. 'thewriter = writer(f)' assign a writer responsible for writing on f
    4. 'header = ['Title', 'location', 'price', 'area']' csv means comma seperated values, and the list 'header', writes cells
    5. 'thewriter.writerow(header)' this codeline writes the row that defines data classification
    6. add 'thewriter.writerow(info)' within the for loop to continuously print row by row
